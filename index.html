            <p>I work as a system administrator at Electroservice and Co. My main aspiration is to help people solve their problems. This requires care, patience and the ability to understand the problem. All these qualities are in me.</p>
            <p>During my tenure, in addition to the usual duties of a system administrator, I needed to do the layout of web pages. This was due to the additional work of the administrator of some sites. This direction became interesting to me and therefore I want to develop in this direction.</p>
